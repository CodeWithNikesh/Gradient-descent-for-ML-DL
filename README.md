Project Title: Gradient Descent Linear Regression
Name : Nikesh Singh

Description: This project implements a simple linear regression model using gradient descent optimization. The GDRegressor class allows users to fit a linear model to their data by minimizing the mean squared error through iterative updates of the slope (m) and intercept (b). The model is trained using a specified number of epochs and a learning rate that controls the step size during the optimization process.

Key Features:

Fitting the Model: The fit method trains the model on the input features X and target values y.
Making Predictions: The predict method allows users to make predictions on new data based on the learned parameters.
Usage: To use the model, instantiate the GDRegressor, call fit with your data, and then use predict to get the output.
